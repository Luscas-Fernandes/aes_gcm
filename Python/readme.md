AES working in gcm mode using python library pycryptodome

The python program checks if you have pycryptodome library installed
If you don't, asks if you wanna install it

__ Unfortunately the check is not working properly, at least in my machine __

The program may run in its default path, using "CESAR School" as plain text or you may
choose to change the default plain text message to any other as you wish

Otherwise you may leave the program, it finishes and clears terminal
